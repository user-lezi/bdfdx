# BDFDX
An external API for BDFD, adding the features that BDFD is too lazy to implement. 😎

---

## 🚀 Setup

1. **Fork the repository**  
2. **Create a `.env` file** with the following:
```env
PORT=4000
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
PASSWORD=your_panel_password
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm init -y   # if not already done
npm install
```
4. Run the server
```bash
node dist/index.js
```
5. Access the API
- Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api/*`
- Include your password in the headers: password: "your_panel_password"

6. Access the panel
- The web panel is available at the same host once the server is running.
